# Boston-Housing
Prediction of the house prices at Boston using machine learning techniques.

We will be going to use the 'Bostonhousing' data provided in the 'mlbencher' package, where will be having our concerns over the pricing of the houses in the ares of Boston.
Steps-
a)Load the data, see the data types of all the columns. (I suggest you to look for the definitions of all the variables for better understanding.)
b)Try to get the relation between the independent variables with the 'medv' variable, which says about the median values of all of the owner occupied houses in 1000 dollars.
c)Prepare a linear regression model as we are tackling a regression type SVM. And use it for prediction!
d)Get the accuracy for the model for checking its validation.

We see that, all the different parameters affect the house rates in some way or the other.
